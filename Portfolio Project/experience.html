                    <h3>NOC Technician</h3>
                    <span class="year">2024 - Present</span>
                    <p>I have over a year of experience as a NOC (Network Operations Center) Technician at CAS Cloud
                        Data Center. I have gained total knowledge of networking, system monitoring, and incident
                        handling while working here. I am also very experienced in using various tools such as AVTECH,
                        Zabbix, Check MK, and lots more to ensure system uptime and responsiveness. Besides technical
                        skills, I prepare in-depth monthly reports regularly through Excel and effectively interact with
                        clients to solve issues, provide timely support, and maintain customer satisfaction. My work has
                        solidified my problem-solving abilities and my capability to work in high-pressure situations.

                    <h3>WordPress Developer</h3>
                    <span class="year">2023</span>
                    <p>During my diploma course, I have done several projects on WordPress, thus gaining firsthand
                        experience with the platform. I am familiar with WordPress themes, plugins, and other
                        customization features. I just finished building a new portfolio site for a client using
                        WordPress, incorporating custom CSS to enhance the design and user experience to the client's
                        satisfaction. I also have experience with web hosting, including domain configuration, cPanel
                        management, and deploying sites to live servers. This direct exposure has consolidated my skills
                        in both front-end customization and basic back-end configuration within the WordPress platform.
